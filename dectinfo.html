    <h2>What is DECT?</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <p>DECT stands for Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications and is a wireless phone protocol, usually used for cordless landlines. This protocol, however, is not limited to this, and in fact could be used, in theory, to create a DECT mobile phone network, and that's where we come in! Veridian Mobile has started Research and Developent to create a mobile cell network that operates using the DECT protocol. This protocol could be a big thing because of the affordabilty of cordless landline phones in recent years, as well as operating in a very similar way to traditional cell networks. DECT uses dynamic frequency assignment based on other phone systems nearby, so that they dont interfere with each other. This means that multiple DECT phone users can have a seperate call without interfering with each other, which is very similar to a traditional cell network. Unfortunately, smartphones do not contain a DECT modem, and therefore cannot be used on a DECT network, which means only DECT landline phones can be used. This would be useful for certain business or backup needs, and there is no need for a base station. All you will need is the phone and a charging base, and we handle the rest.</p>
