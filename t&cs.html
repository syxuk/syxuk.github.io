All services are provided on an "as-is" basis, and Veridian Mobile explicitly disclaims any and all representations or warranties, whether express or implied, regarding the sufficiency, adequacy, or functionality of its network for any particular purpose, including but not limited to the use of services for primary telecommunications. Payments for services are strictly required to be made at the commencement of the applicable billing period, whether on a monthly or annual basis, and not at the conclusion of said period, as is common with other service providers; furthermore, you acknowledge that such payments are non-refundable under any circumstance unless explicitly stated otherwise, and Veridian Mobile does not offer refunds for any products or services, including but not limited to SIM cards, mobile phones, or accessories, except where such an offer is specifically and expressly stated in writing by Veridian Mobile. Any promotional offers, including but not limited to those referencing "Affordable Plans," "Unbeatable Prices," or "Free Unlimited Plan," shall not be construed as fixed or guaranteed pricing and are subject to change, modification, suspension, or termination at the sole discretion of Veridian Mobile at any time, with or without prior notice, and such promotions are only valid for a limited time and are contingent upon availability, which may be altered without prior notification. Any claims regarding "UK-Exclusive Coverage" shall not be understood as a promise or guarantee of any current or future network service in any particular region of the UK, and you expressly acknowledge that Veridian Mobileâ€™s network is under ongoing development, with no assurance, express or implied, that the network will expand to provide coverage in any specific location or achieve nationwide reliability, nor shall Veridian Mobile be held liable for any failure to deliver network expansion or coverage. Furthermore, references to "Simple Setup" are intended solely as marketing language, and the process of activating and using Veridian Mobile services may involve steps, procedures, and technical configurations that are more involved than implied, and no warranty is provided that services will be immediately available or operational upon the insertion of a SIM card or initial setup; you accept and agree that you bear full responsibility for completing any necessary steps, whether technical, administrative, or otherwise, to fully enable and utilise the services, and Veridian Mobile disclaims any responsibility for ensuring or assisting with the completion of the setup process.
